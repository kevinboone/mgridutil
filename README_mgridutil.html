<h1>mgridutil</h1>
<p>v0.0.1</p>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p><code>mgridutil</code> is a very simple command-line utility for Linux and similar, that
can do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Convert a Maidenhead grid locator (4 or 6-charater) to a latitute and
longitude, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calulate the distance and bearing between two Maidenhead locators</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is primarily intended for working out the distance between
two amateur radio stations.</p>
<p><code>mgridutil</code> is wrtten in standard C, but with GNU extensions; any recent
version of GCC on any platform should be able to build it.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>If the program is invoked with one argument, it displays the
corresponding latitude and longitude, as a pair of decimal numbers.
Negative values are west/south.</p>
<p>If the program is invoked with two arguments, it calculates the
distance and bearing <em>from</em> the first locator <em>to</em> the second. This
emphasis is important because, despite common perception, you can't
reverse bearings on the Earth's surface by turning through 180 degrees --
not over significant distances, anyway.</p>
<p>If the <code>--km</code> switch is given, distance is displayed in kilometres,
otherwise in miles.</p>
<h2>Building</h2>
<p>Get the source from https://github.com/kevinboone/mgridutil.</p>
<p>To build and install:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
$ sudo make install
</code></pre>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Because Maidenhead locators are not particularly precise in themselves,
all results should be regarded as approximate. Moreover, for simplicity,
the utility assumes that the Earth is spherical, which it isn't.</p>
<p>Garbage in, garbage out -- the utility doesn't (and, for the most part can't)
check that a grid locator makes sense. </p>
